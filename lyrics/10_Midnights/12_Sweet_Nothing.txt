I spy with my little tired eye, tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket, we almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes? Ooh, ooh
They said the end is comin', everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin', you're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
On the way home, I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time, ooh, ooh
'Cause they said the end is comin', everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin', you're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talkin' hucksters out glad-handin' each other
And the voices that implore, "You should be doin' more"
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it, ooh
They said the end is comin', everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin', you're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' (they said the end is comin')
Everyone's up to somethin' (everyone's up to somethin')
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin' (outside, they're push and shovin')
You're in the kitchen hummin' (you're in the kitchen hummin')
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
