It feels like a perfect night,
To dress up like hipsters,
And make fun of our exes.
Oh-ah, oh-ah.
It feels like a perfect night,
For breakfast at midnight,
To fall in love with strangers.
Oh-ah, oh-ah.
Yeah! We're happy, free, confused,
And lonely at the same time,
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah! Tonight's the night when,
We forget about the deadlines,
It's time, uh-oh!
I don't know about you,
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
Everything will be alright if,
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me,
But I'll bet you want to,
Everything will be alright,
If we just keep dancing,
Like we're, twenty-two, twenty-two!
It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded,
Too many cool kids.
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew).
Oh-ah, oh-ah.
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene,
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping.
Yeah! We're happy, free, confused,
And lonely in the best way,
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah! Tonight's the night when,
We forget about the heartbreaks,
It's time, uh-oh!
I don't know about you,
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
Everything will be alright if,(Ooh)
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me,
But I'll bet you want to,
Everything will be alright if,(Alright)
We just keep dancing,
Like we're twenty-two, (oh-uh-uh-uh-oh),
Twenty-two! (I don't know about you)!
Twenty-two, twenty-two!
It feels like one of those nights!
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights!
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights!
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you, I gotta have you!
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, hey!
I don't know about you,
(I don't know about you)!
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
Everything will be alright if, (Ooh)
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me,
(You don't know about me)!
But I'll bet you want to,
Everything will be alright if,
We just keep dancing, (dance like we're),
Like we're twenty-two, (oh-woah-oh),
Twenty-two, (dancing like),
Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah)!
Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah, yeah)!
It feels like one of those nights!
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights!
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights!
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you, I gotta have you!
