See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Tripping, tripping when you're gone
'Cause we breakdown a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall, right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face, so it goes
I'm yours to keep and I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl
But I do bad things with you, so it goes
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skipping, skipping when I'm gone
'Cause we breakdown a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall, right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face, so it goes
I'm yours to keep and I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl
But I do bad things with you, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
You did a number on me
But honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?
(1, 2, 3)
And all the pieces fall, right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face, so it goes
I'm yours to keep and I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl
But I do bad things with you, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
