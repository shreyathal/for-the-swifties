Forgive me, Peter, my lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar, preserved from when we were just kids
Is it something I did?
The goddess of timing once found us beguiling
She said she was trying, Peter, was she lying? My ribs
Get the feeling she did
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now
You said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep
Are you still a mind-reader, a natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter, but life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me, when crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon
In different galaxies
And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now
You said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep
Never to keep
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were 25
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life
Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold on (hold on) to the days (to the days)
When you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light
You said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up (ah)
You said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep
