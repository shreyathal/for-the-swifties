I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
North bound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing so
I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time
You had stopped and tilted your head
I still ponder what it meant now, now
Now, now, now, now
I tried searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be downtown
Downtown, downtown
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the 'if only'
So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time
