Flamingo pink
Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink
Being this young is art
Aquamarine
Moonlit swimming pool
What if all I need is you?
Got lovestruck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick, all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't
But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be looking at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
Might as well be drunk in love
Send the code, he's waiting there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him
That was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman
Got lovestruck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick, all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
We'll pay the price, I guess
But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be looking at us
If they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love
Half asleep
Taking your time
In the tangerine, neon light
This is luxury
You're not saying you're in love with me
But you're going to
Half awake
Taking your chance
It's a big mistake
I said it might blow up in your pretty face
I'm not saying do it anyway
But you're going to
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
Might as well be drunk in love
