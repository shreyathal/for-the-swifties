Today was a fairytale
You were the prince, I used to be a damsel in destress
You took me by the hand and you pick me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress, you wore a dark gray T-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile, takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say, is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart, it's beating in my chest
Did you feel it? I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh
Today was a fairytale
